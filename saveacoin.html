                <p class="text-muted">
                    To lay the foundation for the Save-a-Coin app, we conducted comprehensive research into the most popular budget tracking and saving apps on the market. We analyzed 12 leading apps, including Goodbudget, Ibotta, Monarch, and others. Our goal was to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each app, focusing on usability, feature set, availability, and reach.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                    To synthesize our findings, we created a Function Matrix to map out essential features and identify areas where existing apps fell short. This process guided our brainstorming sessions and informed our approach to designing a comprehensive and user-friendly money-saving experience.</p>

                <p class="text-muted">
                    The next step in the project was to identify our target audience and stakeholders. After thorough analysis, we determined that the primary users of the Save-a-Coin app are adults, college students, families, and online shoppers, focusing on individuals seeking financial control, expense tracking, and efficient saving strategies. The key stakeholders include investors, business partners, competitor apps, the stock market, developers, and app employees.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">To better understand our users, we created three detailed personas to visualize their needs and preferences.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Throughout the design process, we engaged with potential users to <b>gather feedback</b> on our prototypes. This feedback was crucial in refining the design before finalizing the screens.</p>

                <p class="text-muted">Logo was something our team experimented with a lot. From trying out different colors and typefaces to completely reestablishing the main elements. The initial logo features a lot of different animal outlines in black color with the name "Petter" underneath. However, it seemed a bit <b>outdated</b> and <b>not as catchy</b>.</p>

                <p class="text-muted">We wanted to create a simple logo but still incorporate a color palette that would feature pets as the primary goal of our brand. After brainstorming and making several new sketches to best represent what our app is about, we decided to use a <b>minimalist</b> dog profile outline resembling a letter "P," which then became the new face of PETTER.

                <p class="text-muted">
                    Throughout the development of PETTER, we encountered several challenges that required iteration, testing, and problem-solving to ensure the best possible user experience. From UI complexity to backend issues, these obstacles pushed us to refine our design and improve functionality.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">
                        During early <b>design iterations</b>, during user testing, some reported several screens being <b>cluttered</b>, containing too much information, making users feel overwhelmed and unsure where to focus. Moreover, some users reported <b>difficulty locating</b> important features, such as the "Vets" section, due to its placement in the app. This lack of <b>intuitive navigation</b> created friction in the user journey.</p>
                        <p class="text-muted">
                            During development, we faced issues with <b>Firebase integration</b>, leading to unexpected <b>bugs</b> that temporarily prevented some core functionalities from working properly. This particularly affected <b>data synchronizatio</b> and scheduling features.</p>
                           <p class="text-muted">
                            By identifying these challenges early and iterating based on <b>user feedback</b>, we were able to enhance PETTER’s usability and performance. The result was a more refined, <b>accessible</b>, and <b>seamless experience</b> that effectively meets the needs of pet owners.</p>
